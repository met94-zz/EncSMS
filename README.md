Simple SMS app with message encoding by password.<br />

## Info
SMS messages are encoded with a password provided by the user. Encoding algorithm guarantees that all characters will be visible ASCII characters. Passwords are not stored so using wrong one to open conversation still causes decoding but the result is other than original.
